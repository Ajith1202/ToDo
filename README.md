-------------------------------------------------TO DO LIST WEB APPLICATION--------------------------------------------------------- 

My first Django project . 

Had a great video tutorial on this by Dennis Ivy, on youtube . I watched the tutorial 2-3 times and understood the concepts of Models and ModelForms.
Then I completed the whole thing from scratch, using the Django documentation to clear any doubts.

Finally, I styled the whole thing using Bootstrap.

Hope someone finds this helpfull.
